# Robot Programming for Maze Navigation using Odometry and Motion Sensors

The Thymio robot was programmed to use infrared commands and autonomously navigate through the maze. It utilizes odometry and sensors to navigate independently, reaching various checkpoints and adjusting its path based on obstacles, providing accurate and efficient navigation throughout the maze.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation through a maze
- Utilizes infrared commands
- Odometry for accurate positioning
- Motion sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Thymio robot
- [Aseba](https://www.thymio.org/en:aseba) software

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Henrique-Barata/Robot-programing-for-a-maze-navigation-using-odometry-and-motion-sensors-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Robot-programing-for-a-maze-navigation-using-odometry-and-motion-sensors-
    ```
3. Upload the code to your Thymio robot using Aseba.

## Usage

1. Place the Thymio robot at the starting point of the maze.
2. Run the program on the Thymio robot.
3. The robot will navigate through the maze autonomously, adjusting its path based on obstacles and checkpoints.
